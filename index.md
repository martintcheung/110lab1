### Intro
Hi there! I'm a sophomore at UCSD studying **Computer Science**.
I love coding! (*especially trying to solve board games*)
I also pride myself on my ability to debug, not that I enjoy it.

In the words of no one:
> Debugging is fun!

My favorite programming language at the moment is `C++`. The language has taught me so much about memory and how it's allocated and deallocated.

Currently, I enjoy using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for my text editor/IDE.

Some of my non-STEM hobbies include:
- Bouldering
- Backpacking
- Cooking

### Goals
[x] Learn the ins and outs of data structures and when/how to use them

[x] Learn multiple programming languages

[ ] Complete my sophomore year at UCSD

[ ] Survive COVID
